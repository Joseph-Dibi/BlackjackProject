## BlackJack Project

### Overview
This is a Blackjack simulator.

The player gets 1000 gold with which to make bets. They are allowed to split hands if doubles are dealt. Aces can be either high or low. If the player does not bust, the dealer's turn begins. Dealer turn is automated and if the Dealer does not bust, the hands are evaluated to determine a winner. The player is then given the option to play again. The purse does not reset between games. If you run out of money you lose and are unable to play more.

### What I learned
For this project I tried to use a lot of methods. This made it easy to do things repeatedly and to make changes on my program. The methods each had a specific function and I would simply modify the method to modify the behavior in every instance of its use. This worked out well, the only issue I had with the methods were the playAgain/startGame method since any change to what was put in startGame required me to change every instance of playAgain to match it. I would clean this up if I was going to do the project again. I also learned about the importance of sticking to one item at a time as working on multiple items at once was a slow process filled with bugs.
